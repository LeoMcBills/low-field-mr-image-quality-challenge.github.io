      The recent resurgence of portable, very low-field MRI systems to improve accessibility is constrained by image quality challenges compared to clinical scanners. The advent of machine learning methods provides a unique opportunity to address gaps in image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As very-low-field MRI gains the attention of the wider research community, this timely grand challenge invites participants from complementary backgrounds in signal processing, MRI analysis, machine learning, and related fields to break ground on this important topic of image quality. 
      The challenge starts in Sep. 2024 and will last until Jun. 2025.

              Participants can choose to pursue either or both challenge tracks and demonstrate it on the datasets described below. 
              Each participant or team needs to host all source-code related to the challenge on a repository such as GitHub with an easy-to-use readme file containing instructions for installation and usage that enables reproducing their results. 
              Participants are recommended to test their algorithms on both datasets.

        description : >
              The denoising track will focus on developing, adapting, or integrating methods and algorithms that can increase the SNR by two-fold, i.e., reduce the noise by four times. While the use of deep learning algorithms has made significant progress in the denoising setting, the main challenge in the low-field setting is that algorithms lack multiple high-quality reference datasets that can be used to train these algorithms. Zero-shot, few-shot, transfer learning, and methods that do not require noiseless reference data may be better suited in this setting. 
              The computation of the signal-to-noise ratio will follow the methods used in Ref. [3].

        title:       "Track 2: Super-resolution reconstruction"
        description : >
              Most MRI data used for segmentation and volumetry tasks are acquired at 1mm isotropic resolution. However, the low SNR at low fields often restricts the resolution to 1.5 x 1.5 x 5 mm3 to keep the scan time reasonable. While super-resolution reconstruction of natural images has advanced significantly, this lack of extensive high-quality low-field data makes this ill-posed problem a critical barrier to using portable MRIs for volumetric measurements, especially in the brain. The focus is to use ground truth data from phantoms and gold standard data from 3T acquisitions to train low-field super-resolution algorithms. 
              The challenge is to use available very-low-field data comprising single or multiple orthogonal acquisitions to reconstruct a 1mm isotropic image volume with less than 5% error compared to the ground truth phantom data based on the vendor measurements.
